# 🧠 Deep Learning Playground – Summer AI Journey

Welcome to my **PyTorch deep learning practice repo**!
This is a **daily learning log** based on the [Zero to Mastery PyTorch course by Daniel Bourke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypd3aH6dY9s).

🎯 **Mission**: Build a strong, self-reliant foundation in deep learning — from core concepts to real-world projects.
