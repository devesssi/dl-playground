# 🧠 Deep Learning Playground – Summer AI Journey

Welcome to my PyTorch deep learning practice repo!  
This is a **daily log** of everything I’m learning and building from the **Zero to Mastery PyTorch course by Daniel Bourke**.  
The goal: **build a strong foundation** in deep learning — from basics to real-world projects.
