# 🧠 Deep Learning Playground – Summer AI Journey

Welcome to my PyTorch deep learning practice repo!  
This is a daily log of everything I’m learning and building from the **Zero to Mastery PyTorch course by Daniel Bourke**.  
The goal is to build a strong foundation in deep learning, starting from the very basics and moving toward real projects.
